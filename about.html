    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      During a time when I was feeling dissatisfied in my previous career, I
      began coding by working my way through a beginnerâ€™s book on Python.
    </p>
    <p>I knew even then I had found something I was truly passionate about.</p>
    <p>
      Thinking my way through logical problems and developing projects to expand
      my skills has been a truly rewarding journey.
