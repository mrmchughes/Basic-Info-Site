# Basic-Info-Site

I developed this Basic Info Site as part of The Odin Project's Fullstack [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-basic-informational-site).

This was an exciting project to get to, as it's the first project I've written in Node.js. I'm excited to dig further into the backend and create more exciting projects!
